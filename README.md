# unityAR

DATE: 18022021 - 18052021
DIFFICULTY: ★★☆☆☆
SOFTWARE: UNITY, VUFORIA


My very first programming project I did during my Internship days at ST Engineering.

I briefly remember my days as a Polytechnic student doing my internship in that company. I was assigned this project with a fellow partner to create an app that utilizes Augmented Reality
to improve the efficiency of certain Engine Inspection processes in the company.

In this project, it took me a week and a few days to learn and grasp the concepts of Unity and it's library, Vuforia. Though the project came out to be a tad bit simple and unpolished in
my opinion, it was the first project I ever did, and I was so damn proud of it :)
